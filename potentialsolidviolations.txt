IUserInterfaceElement: calling Update with inheritors aside from CurrentTime will crash - Liskov Substitution
IUserInterfaceElement - Update is never used but subclasses are forced to implement it - Interface Segregation
App.Run potentially does too much, as it not only handles main program logic but also handles saving and loading of files - Single Responsibility




Liskov Substitution - If you swap a subclass for another, it should not break functionality
Single Responsibility - Each class/method has a single responsibility
Open/Closed - Open for Extension, Closed for Modification
Dependency Inversion Principle - Higher level classes should not depend on lower level classes, both should depend on abstractions
Interface Segregation Principle - Clients should not be forced to implement methods they don't use
